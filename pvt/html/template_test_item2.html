    <p>Piet is a language designed by David Morgan-Mar, whose programs are 
        bitmaps that look like abstract art.[9] The compilation is guided by
        a "pointer" that moves around the image, from one continuous coloured
        region to the next. Procedures are carried through when the pointer 
        exits a region.
        </p>

    <p>There are 20 colours for which behaviour is specified: 18 "colourful" colours,
        which are ordered by a 6-step hue cycle and a 3-step brightness cycle; and black
        and white which are not ordered. When exiting a "colourful" colour and entering
        another one, the performed procedure is determined by the number of steps of change
        in hue and brightness. Black cannot be entered; when the pointer tries to enter a 
        black region, the rules of choosing the next block are changed instead. If all possible
        rules are tried, the program terminates. Regions outside the borders of the image are also 
        treated as black. White does not perform operations, but allows the pointer to "pass through". 
        The behaviour of colours other than the 20 specified is left to the compiler or interpreter.
        </p>

    <p>Variables are stored in memory as signed integers in a single stack. Most specified procedures deal with operations 
        on that stack, others with input/output and with the rules by which the compilation pointer moves. </p>
